## Project Overview

In this project, you will apply the skills you have acquired in this course to operational a Machine Learning Microservice API. 

You are given a pre-trained, `sklearn` model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on. You can read more about the data, which was initially taken from Kaggle, on [the data source site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing). This project tests your ability to operationalize a Python flask app—in a provided file, `app.py`—that serves out predictions (inference) about housing prices through API calls. This project could be extended to any pre-trained machine learning model, such as those for image recognition and data labeling.

### Project Tasks

Your project goal is to operational this working, machine learning microservice using [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), which is an open-source system for automating the management of containerized applications. In this project you will:
* Test your project code using linting
* Complete a Dockerfile to containerize this application
* Deploy your containerized application using Docker and make a prediction
* Improve the log statements in the source code for this application
* Configure Kubernetes and create a Kubernetes cluster
* Deploy a container using Kubernetes and make a prediction
* Upload a complete GitHub repo with CircleCI to indicate that your code has been tested

You can find a detailed [project rubric, here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2576/view).

**The final implementation of the project will showcase your abilities to operational production microservices.**

## Set up the Environment

* Install Python3.7
```bash
sudo apt install libssl-dev libncurses5-dev libsqlite3-dev libreadline-dev libtk8.6 libgdm-dev libdb4o-cil-dev libpcap-dev
cd ~
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.3/Python-3.7.3.tar.xz
tar xvf Python-3.7.3.tar.xz
cd Python-3.7.3
./configure
sudo make
# Regularly common way is make install
# sudo make install
# Or using make altinstall to avoid override the existing Python lower version
sudo make altinstall
```

* Create a virtualenv with Python 3.7 and activate it. Refer to this link for help on specifying the Python version in the virtualenv. 
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
# You should have Python 3.7 available in your host. 
# Check the Python path using `which python3`
# Use a command similar to this one:
python3 -m virtualenv --python=<path-to-Python3.7> .devops
source .devops/bin/activate
```
* Run `make install` to install the necessary dependencies

### Running `app.py`

1. Standalone:  `python app.py`
2. Run in Docker:  `./run_docker.sh`
3. Run in Kubernetes:  `./run_kubernetes.sh`

### Kubernetes Steps

* Setup and Configure Docker locally
  * Go to https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/ and follow the instruction to install docker desktop
  * Verify installation by `docker --version`
* Setup and Configure Kubernetes locally
  * On Windows the best way is using Docker Desktop. Go into the setting -> Kubernetes -> Check on Enable Kubernetes.
  * Verify by `kubectl version --output json`
* Create Flask app in Container
  * First create an image: `docker build --tag project-ml:v1.0.0 .`
  * Then run the container with created image: `docker run --detach --publish 8000:80 project-ml:v1.0.0`
* Run via kubectl
  * Create an environment file (.env) that contain your Docker password with the variable called MY_PASSWORD=<your-docker-hub-pw> then run: `source .env`
  * Export your docker hub ID: `export docker_path=<your-docker-hub-id>`
  * First need to log in with Docker Hub to push the image: `echo "$MY_PASSWORD" | docker login --username $docker_path --password-stdin`
  * Then tag and push the image: `docker image tag project-ml:v1.0.0 $docker_path/project-ml:v1.0.0 && docker image push $docker_path/project-ml:v1.0.0`
  * Finally, run: `kubectl create deploy project-ml-microservice-kubernetes --image="$docker_path/project-ml:v1.0.0"`
  * Check whether the pod is in READY state: `kubectl get pods`
  * After the pod is in ready state forward the port: `kubectl port-forward deployment.apps/project-ml-microservice-kubernetes 8000:80`

### Description of the files
* .dockerignore: Ignore the file when using COPY command in Dockerfile
* .env: The environment variable file that contain secret variable like Docker Hub password
* app.py: The API that use for predicting house pricing
* Dockerfile: The instruction for the docker build to build an image
* make_prediction.sh: The script to call API
* Makefile: The instruction file to set up environment, install dependencies, test and lint
* README.md: This file is containing help content.
* requirements.txt: Contains all dependencies.
* run_docker.sh: The script for running all steps with Docker.
* run_kubernetes.sh: Same as above but for Kubernetes.
* upload_docker.sh: The script for uploading an image into dockerhub for the kubernetes running.
